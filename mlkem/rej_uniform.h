/*************************************************
 * Name:        rej_uniform
 *
 * Description: Run rejection sampling on uniform random bytes to generate
 *              uniform random integers mod q
 *
 * Arguments:   - int16_t *r:          pointer to output buffer
 *              - unsigned int target: requested number of 16-bit integers
 *                                     (uniform mod q).
 *                                     Must be <= 4096.
 *              - unsigned int offset: number of 16-bit integers that have
 *                                     already been sampled.
 *                                     Must be <= target.
 *              - const uint8_t *buf:  pointer to input buffer
 *                                     (assumed to be uniform random bytes)
 *              - unsigned int buflen: length of input buffer in bytes
 *                                     Must be <= 4096.
 *                                     Must be a multiple of 3.
 *
 * Note: Strictly speaking, only a few values of buflen near UINT_MAX need
 * excluding. The limit of 4096 is somewhat arbitary but sufficient for all
 * uses of this function. Similarly, the actual limit for target is UINT_MAX/2.
 *
 * Returns the new offset of sampled 16-bit integers, at most target,
 * and at least the initial offset.
 * If the new offset is strictly less than len, all of the input buffers
 * is guaranteed to have been consumed. If it is equal to len, no information
 * is provided on how many bytes of the input buffer have been consumed.
 **************************************************/

// REF-CHANGE: The signature differs from the Kyber reference implementation
// in that it adds the offset and always expects the base of the target
// buffer. This avoids shifting the buffer base in the caller, which appears
// tricky to reason about.
